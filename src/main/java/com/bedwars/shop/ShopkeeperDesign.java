/**
 * This class contains the design for integrating Citizens2 NPCs as shopkeepers.
 * Including NPC types, appearances, behaviors, and integration with the shop system.
 */

public class ShopkeeperDesign {

    // NPC Types to consider:
    //   - Villager (default)
    //   - Zombie (scary, maybe for special shop)
    //   - Skeleton (archer, for ranged weapon shop)
    //   - Spider (for armor or something)
    //   - Creeper (for explosive items)

    // Traits to define:
    //   - Appearance (head, skin, items worn)
    //   - Dialogue (what they say to players)
    //   - Interactions (when clicked, what happens)
    //   - Integration with shop system (link to shop category)

    // Example: A villager shopkeeper might handle buying and selling items.
    // A zombie shopkeeper might handle selling weapons or health items.

    // Implementation steps:
    //   1. Create NPC using Citizens2 API
    //   2. Set appearance and traits
    //   3. Link to shop category
    //   4. Handle player interaction

    // This is a design document; actual implementation will be in separate classes.
